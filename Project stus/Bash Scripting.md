Certainly! Here are some advanced Bash scripting-based projects focused on cybersecurity:

### 1. Automated Vulnerability Scanner
Create a Bash script to automate the process of scanning a network or system for vulnerabilities.

**Components:**
- Use tools like `nmap` for network scanning.
- Integrate with `OpenVAS` or `Nessus` for vulnerability assessment.
- Generate a report summarizing the findings.

**Sample Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define target network
TARGET="192.168.1.0/24"
REPORT="vulnerability_report.txt"

# Perform network scan
echo "Scanning network..."
nmap -sV $TARGET -oN nmap_scan.txt

# Run OpenVAS scan
echo "Running OpenVAS scan..."
omp -u admin -w admin --xml="<create_target><name>Target</name><hosts>$TARGET</hosts></create_target>"
TARGET_ID=$(omp -u admin -w admin -G | grep "Target" | awk '{print $1}')
omp -u admin -w admin --xml="<start_task task_id=\"$TARGET_ID\"/>"

# Wait for the scan to complete (adjust the sleep time as necessary)
sleep 600

# Retrieve OpenVAS report
echo "Retrieving OpenVAS report..."
omp -u admin -w admin -G -R > openvas_report.txt

# Combine reports
cat nmap_scan.txt openvas_report.txt > $REPORT
echo "Vulnerability scan completed. Report saved to $REPORT."
```

### 2. Automated Log Analysis and Alerting
Develop a Bash script to monitor system logs for suspicious activity and send alerts.

**Components:**
- Monitor `/var/log/auth.log` for failed login attempts.
- Use `sendmail` or `mailx` to send email alerts.
- Optionally, integrate with Slack or other messaging platforms for notifications.

**Sample Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

LOGFILE="/var/log/auth.log"
ALERT_EMAIL="admin@example.com"
TEMPFILE="/tmp/failed_logins.tmp"

# Initialize the temporary file
> $TEMPFILE

# Monitor the log file for failed login attempts
tail -Fn0 $LOGFILE | while read line; do
    echo "$line" | grep "Failed password" >> $TEMPFILE

    # Check if there are more than 5 failed login attempts
    if [ $(wc -l < $TEMPFILE) -ge 5 ]; then
        echo "Too many failed login attempts detected!" | mailx -s "Alert: Failed Login Attempts" $ALERT_EMAIL
        # Optionally, clear the temporary file
        > $TEMPFILE
    fi
done
```

### 3. Automated Backup and Restore
Create a Bash script to automate the backup and restore process for critical data.

**Components:**
- Use `rsync` for efficient file backups.
- Schedule the script using `cron` for regular backups.
- Provide options to restore from backups.

**Sample Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

BACKUP_DIR="/backup"
SOURCE_DIR="/important_data"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/backup.log"

# Perform backup
echo "Starting backup at $TIMESTAMP" | tee -a $LOG_FILE
rsync -avz $SOURCE_DIR $BACKUP_DIR/latest
tar -czf $BACKUP_FILE -C $BACKUP_DIR latest
echo "Backup completed: $BACKUP_FILE" | tee -a $LOG_FILE

# Restore function
restore() {
    echo "Restoring from $1" | tee -a $LOG_FILE
    tar -xzf $1 -C /
    echo "Restore completed" | tee -a $LOG_FILE
}

# Check if restore option is provided
if [ "$1" == "--restore" ] && [ -n "$2" ]; then
    restore $2
fi
```

### 4. Automated Malware Analysis Sandbox
Create a Bash script to set up a sandbox environment for analyzing suspicious files.

**Components:**
- Use `Docker` to create isolated environments.
- Automate the process of setting up the sandbox, running the analysis, and collecting results.
- Use tools like `ClamAV` for malware scanning.

**Sample Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

SANDBOX_DIR="/sandbox"
MALWARE_FILE="$1"
REPORT_FILE="$SANDBOX_DIR/report.txt"

# Create sandbox environment using Docker
echo "Setting up sandbox environment..."
docker run -d --name sandbox -v $SANDBOX_DIR:/data ubuntu

# Copy malware file to sandbox
docker cp $MALWARE_FILE sandbox:/data/malware

# Run analysis inside sandbox
echo "Running malware analysis..."
docker exec sandbox apt-get update
docker exec sandbox apt-get install -y clamav
docker exec sandbox clamscan /data/malware > $REPORT_FILE

# Collect and display results
echo "Analysis completed. Report:"
cat $REPORT_FILE

# Clean up
docker stop sandbox
docker rm sandbox
```

### Final Thoughts
These advanced Bash scripting projects will help you gain practical experience in automating various aspects of cybersecurity, from vulnerability scanning and log analysis to backup management and malware analysis. Adjust and extend these scripts based on your specific needs and environment.
